👋🏽 Hi, my name is Steven
🎓 Soon to be grad with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering from Clemson University (May 2023)
🌇 South Carolina Native, with a passion for creating software to improve the lives of all. 
📚 I'm currently a Computer Engineering Major with an interest in software engineering as well as machine learning. I have worked as a Software Developer for Itron within their R&D Team where I learned comprehensive and clean coding practices as well as what it is like to work within a large team of other software developers. At my time at Itron, I managed databases using Microsoft SQL Server and built web applications and services in C# all whilst tracking my progress using Azure DevOps. 
💻 As for my future, I hope to one day to work as a software engineer within a diverse team of people. Additionally, I hope that my work as a SWE is impactful and useful. 
🏔 In my free time, I enjoy Olympic weightlifting, boxing, enjoying good food, and travelling.
